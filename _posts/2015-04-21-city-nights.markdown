### The preparation
Yeah

### Carbon nanotubes?

#### Situation:
It started in January 2014. I really liked the project because it was interdisciplinary and applied to 
a real problem. My advisor, the Dr. Edgar Alvarez is a young professor, who is starting to build a material science 
laboratory in the faculty of science. The job was mainly experimental and design, the samples were made in the 
laboratory of my professor and the spectroscopic analysis was made in the applied science and 
technological development center. 

#### Task:
My task was to design the set up of the experiment, including parameters and materials,  to make the 
samples and finally the Physiochemical characterization. It took around 5 months to get the first samples and to
make the first IR, Raman and TGA analysis.

#### Action:
I had access to the Neuroscience institute to perform in vitro cell culture analysis of my samples . After six
months I got a fellowship to perform a 3 months research project for the nanotoxicity of 
carbon nanotubes in Brazil, where I learned another bunch of experimental techniques, biophysics; and it was my 
first International experience. 

#### Result:
After Brazil I came back to mex to finish my thesis. I finished in December 2014. At that time I started to look
for Graduate programs and I defended my thesis, getting cum laude for my thesis project and my
academic records in the BSc.

* It was my first big research project
* It showed me how difficult is to make science
* I learned time management and many life experiences.
* I learned too much science by interacting with  my colleages, and professor

### My business:

#### Situation:
I had to get many part times jobs since I am 14 years old.I worked two years in Wal Mart, and
another year in a different supermarket. After high school, I got a job in Ford company in the sales department,
and after a year I got a job in a HSBC bank in customer service, and sales of insurances. I found my 
ability for sales, but my objective was to study Physics. When I started university I realised that to
succeed in physics there was no possibility of part time jobs.

#### Task:
I developed a product, and turn it into a business.

#### Action:
I found a problem that the city was facing, I made research to find the solution, and I 
developed a successful product. I did marketing, sales, product design, chemistry, etc.

#### result:
I paid my studies and finished within the top 5 percent in the most important university in my country.
I bought my own car after three years, I learned how to manage my time and my two employes.

I

### Questions for the:

* Why did you choose this company?
* Who will be my direct supervisor?
* Are you constantly hiring new people?
* What process will be used to evaluate my performance?
* Are you developing software?
* Do you work long hours sometimes?







### MSc Applied Physics
#### Situation:
I selected TUe because they are very close to the high tech industry. I wanted to do computational 
physics in my MSc. I took Computational Physics and Computational Fluid Dynamics related courses.
In Applied Physics and mechanical engineering, and I found very interesting data science, so I took
business intelligence.

#### Task:
I enjoyed the courses and the team assignments, it was very interesting to work in a multicultural
team and with people from very different backgrounds. For instance in management of new product development
I did not now anybody there, so I saw three dutchies discussing the team assignment and I asked to joing them.
It was a very nice experience, they were three biomedical engineering students and we did a very nice project.
there were some arguing during the work but it wa svery nice. I liked to work with Dutch people.

#### result:
I passed my courses in the first exam rounds and I decided to do my thesis with professor federico Toschi,
so I am there developing Lattice Boltzmann method in a very complex code.

-------------------------------------------------

### Why not here?
#### What I am looking for:
I am looking for a nice team to work with:
* smart people
* leadership supervisor 
* Ambitious people
* Down to earth people

#### What else:
I am starting my professional career outside academia. I like challenging Physical and mathematical problems.
I want to analize data, to develop algorithms and to build software. I am really interested in 
disruptive technologies, which I would like to get deep knowledge in some of them. I also like to know more
about hardware and networks.

#### Why Duyfken?
In the high tech industry, they are starting to offer me positions as a troubleshooting, manufacturing,
test engineer. However, I like more theoretical stuff. I think i like more mathematical stuff or research based.

I can spot trends on data, I am very good at finding erros in software and mathematics.
I had the ability to follow my professor and spot single typos on the equations, signs, or erros in 
the problems. 

I am also interested in high performance computing and I also want to get good money.
