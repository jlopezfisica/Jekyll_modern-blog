It is 04-04-2017, I have been trying to set up a blog. I finally found a nice blog's layout, of course by using a jekyll theme that 
some awesome developer made. I am really into developing code and also into improving my communication skills. I think I got 
many analytical skills but I believe that communication skills are the key. 

On the other hand, I am really enjoying spring. Spring came suddenly, I really felt it this time after spending two winters in 
the Netherlands, without visiting Mexico. It is almost two years of not seeing my family and friends, I am hoping to visit them 
soon. 

Let's continue writing about spring, I have been walking, running and biking these days. I am also taking many pictures of the 
flowers, which I send via whatsapp to my grandmother. Whatsapp is a message app that everyone have in their cellphones or computer.
